From a young age, video games have been a significant part of my life, providing a source of joy, challenge, and inspiration. This deep-seated love for gaming has naturally evolved into a professional ambition to craft experiences that captivate and resonate with players around the world. In my spare time, I love to get lost in the rich, intricate worlds of video games. Some of my favorite titles include Red Dead Redemption, The Last of Us, Ghost of Tsushima, and Elden Ring. These games have not only provided me with countless hours of enjoyment but have also significantly influenced my approach to game design. They exemplify the power of storytelling, character development, and immersive environments, all of which are elements I strive to incorporate into my own projects. Beyond playing games, I find immense value in watching anime and gaming video essays. These mediums offer valuable insights into narrative structure, character arcs, and thematic depth, which are crucial components of compelling game design. Gaming video essays, in particular, provide in-depth analyses and critiques that challenge me to think critically about various design choices and industry trends. My interests also extend to history, philosophy, and folklore, with a particular focus on Japanese and Norse traditions. These subjects fascinate me because they provide rich tapestries of myth, legend, and philosophical thought that can be woven into game narratives to create deeper, more meaningful experiences. Reading about these topics enriches my understanding of storytelling and world-building, essential elements in game design. I am currently honing my skills in game design through comprehensive courses on Udemy, where I am learning to use both Unity and Unreal Engine. These platforms offer robust tools for creating diverse and dynamic game environments, and mastering them is a critical step in my development as a designer. My education covers a wide range of topics, including programming, 3D modeling, and animation, providing me with a well-rounded foundation in game development. Additionally, I have a strong passion for VFX, sound design, and concept art. I believe that these elements are integral to creating a truly immersive game experience. Visual effects bring the game world to life, sound design creates atmosphere and emotional depth, and concept art lays the groundwork for visual storytelling. By exploring these areas, I aim to enhance my ability to create cohesive and engaging game worlds. My ultimate career aspiration is to work for renowned companies such as Naughty Dog or Sucker Punch, where I can contribute to creating memorable gaming experiences. These studios are known for their groundbreaking work in narrative-driven games and innovative design, and I am inspired by their commitment to excellence and creativity. Through my journey in this dynamic and ever-evolving industry, I am committed to continually expanding my knowledge and pushing the boundaries of creativity and innovation. I am excited about the future of video game design and development and look forward to contributing to the creation of games that inspire, entertain, and leave a lasting impact on players around the world.

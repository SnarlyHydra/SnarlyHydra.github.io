Right click to keep the new mesh in the same place. Name this new mesh to “Icing”. With the icing selected, go to edit mode and click the Toggle X-ray button. Select all the middle vertices around the donut and hit the delete key, clicking “Vertices”. ![[Solidify.png]] Go to properties on the icing. Click Generate- Solidify. Drag “Offset” all the way to 1. ![[Designing Icing.png]] Enable snapping. deselect Increment. Select Face Project. Turn off Proportional Editing, enable the Subdivision property to increase number of faces. Now, you can select vertex, press “G” and drag up or down (Using scroll wheel), to create an icing dripping effect. ![[Second Subdivision Surface.png]] With icing selected, add another Subdivision Modifier. ![[Extruding Icing.png]] Enter edit mode, select two vertices, hit “E” to extrude, left click. Repeat 3 times for one icing drip. ![[Shrink Wrap.png]] With Icing selected, go to the modifiers page and add a new modifier. Deform- ShrinkWrap. Use the eye dropper tool next to the modifier and select the donut. Then move the ShrinkWrap modifier to the top of the modifier stack, as it needs to be done before the solidify modifier. Apply the solidify modifier on the icing. ![[Inflate Tool.png]] Enter Sculpt mode and select the Inflate tool. Adjust the brush size and strength of your tool and then sculpt the endings of the icing. This creates a more natural “pooling” effect for the icing. ![[Mask tool.png]] Hit the “M” key to enter the mask tool mode. Adjust brush size and set strength to 1. Apply the mask to the low points of your icing, trying to keep it as even as possible, avoiding the icing drips. Shift+I to invert the mask. ![[Filter Brush and Smooth Brush.png]] Use the filter brush to create an “icing rim” around the donut. Once, happy with size, remove the mask. Select the smooth tool to smooth out some areas that may be too thick or messy. ![[Icing Material.png]] With Icing selected, go to the materials tab and create a new material. Change the colour to pink and turn the roughness down to about 0.2/0.3. ![[Donut Material.png]] Do the same for the donut. Choosing an orangey/yellow colour. ![[Parenting.png]] Select Icing. Shift+click Donut body. Ctrl+P and click Object (Keep Transform), to parent the Donut and Icing together. ![[Countertop.png]] Add mesh- Plane. To add counter top. ![[Image Texture Counter.png]] Add new material on the plane. Base Colour- Image texture. ![[Marble Image.png]] Apply a marble image to the material. ![[Marble Nodes.png]] Enter the Shading tab at the top of the screen to open up the nodes area. Add a new node to change the roughness of the marble. This is to give it more texture. ![[Texturing Marble.png]] These are the nodes and settings needed to add sufficient texture to the marble counter top. ![[Donut Base Texture.png]] Enter Texture Paint mode at the top of the screen. “/” to isolate the donut base when it is selected. Ass new material, add Image Texture. Edit this to the same colour as the donut base as before. ![[UV Unwrap Texture Paint.png]] Paint in a slightly lighter colour around the donut to make it appear more natural. ![[Geometry Nodes for Sprinkles.png]] Enter the Geometry Node tab a the top of the screen and with the icing selected, hit “New Geometry Node”. Add a node that says “Distribute Points on Faces” and connect it to a new node called “Join Geometry”. Don’t forget to also join “Group Input: Geometry” to “Join Geometry: Geometry”.

From a young age, video games have been a significant part of my life, providing a source of joy, challenge, and inspiration. This deep-seated love for gaming has naturally evolved into a professional ambition to craft experiences that captivate and resonate with players around the world. In my spare time, I love to get lost in the rich, intricate worlds of video games. Some of my favorite titles include Red Dead Redemption, The Last of Us, Ghost of Tsushima, and Elden Ring. These games have not only provided me with countless hours of enjoyment but have also significantly influenced my approach to game design. They exemplify the power of storytelling, character development, and immersive environments, all of which are elements I strive to incorporate into my own projects. Beyond playing games, I find immense value in watching anime and gaming video essays. These mediums offer valuable insights into narrative structure, character arcs, and thematic depth, which are crucial components of compelling game design. Gaming video essays, in particular, provide in-depth analyses and critiques that challenge me to think critically about various design choices and industry trends. My interests also extend to history, philosophy, and folklore, with a particular focus on Japanese and Norse traditions. These subjects fascinate me because they provide rich tapestries of myth, legend, and philosophical thought that can be woven into game narratives to create deeper, more meaningful experiences. Reading about these topics enriches my understanding of storytelling and world-building, essential elements in game design. I am currently honing my skills in game design through comprehensive courses on Udemy, where I am learning to use both Unity and Unreal Engine. These platforms offer robust tools for creating diverse and dynamic game environments, and mastering them is a critical step in my development as a designer. My education covers a wide range of topics, including programming, 3D modeling, and animation, providing me with a well-rounded foundation in game development. Additionally, I have a strong passion for VFX, sound design, and concept art. I believe that these elements are integral to creating a truly immersive game experience. Visual effects bring the game world to life, sound design creates atmosphere and emotional depth, and concept art lays the groundwork for visual storytelling. By exploring these areas, I aim to enhance my ability to create cohesive and engaging game worlds. My ultimate career aspiration is to work for renowned companies such as Naughty Dog or Sucker Punch, where I can contribute to creating memorable gaming experiences. These studios are known for their groundbreaking work in narrative-driven games and innovative design, and I am inspired by their commitment to excellence and creativity. Through my journey in this dynamic and ever-evolving industry, I am committed to continually expanding my knowledge and pushing the boundaries of creativity and innovation. I am excited about the future of video game design and development and look forward to contributing to the creation of games that inspire, entertain, and leave a lasting impact on players around the world.

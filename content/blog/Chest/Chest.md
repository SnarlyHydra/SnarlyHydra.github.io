This chest was fun to create, as it is pretty self explanatory. I got to learn more about how to correctly use loop cuts to create an added level of detail. 
This was the first Blender project that I got to use my graphics tablet for. I got to play around with different brush sizes and layering colours.
I feel like I could've improved upon the corner pieces. When painting on top of them, I noticed that the paint was jagged.

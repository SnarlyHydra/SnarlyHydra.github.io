I created this fish before I had a graphics tablet, so sculpting the features with a mouse was quite difficult. With this also being my first attempt at sculpting anything, I was just shooting in the dark.
I am pleased with how it came out, with my main pride being the shape of the body and, at the time, the eyes.
I had decided that I would give it another try when I had a graphics tablet to compare.

With a graphics tablet, and a little more time on Blender, my second attempt at sculpting a fish was much better. The scales, fins, and mouth are a lot more defined and "fish-like". 
I also learnt the importance of different sizes of sculpting tools, and how to add intricate detail. 
I also wanted to focus on mixing some colours on the fish to make it pop more.

This was my first time creating a human character in Blender, and my first time designing hair.
This character was fairly simple, with extruding objects and moving vertices being the main focus. I got to explore the mirror modifier, and understand how that works in relation to where an objects point of origin is placed.
I would like to attempt to rig this character, so I can give it a walk cycle. At a later date, I would also like to try and add more detail to the face to actually give it some features.

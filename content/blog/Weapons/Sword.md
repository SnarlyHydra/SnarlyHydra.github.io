This was fairly simple to create, as the main blade only required a plane. I used a reference image of a sword and traced the outline with a plane. I then extruded it and added faces, allowing for a more solid look. The hilt required a cube to be scaled and extruded to fit to size. 
I struggled a little bit with trying to extrude the faces of the blade's plane out, as some of the faces weren't selecting. But I just re-did the blade, which solved that.

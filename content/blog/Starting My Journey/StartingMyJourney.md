# Starting My Journey

Welcome to my digital playground! My name is Kez, and I'm thrilled to share my journey into the fascinating world of game design. This is a zero-to-hero adventure, as I start with no prior experience in the art of game design/development.

## About Me

I've always been captivated by the magic of video gamesâ€”the mesmerizing visual effects (VFX), the immersive music, and the stunning scenery that games showcase. These elements create an atmosphere that transports players to different worlds, and I aspire to be a part of crafting such experiences.

## Learning Path

To embark on this journey, I'm leveraging resources like Udemy and YouTube, which offer a wealth of tutorials and courses on game design and development. These platforms have been invaluable in providing me with the foundational knowledge I need to get started.

## Tools and Languages

I'm currently focused on mastering two powerful game engines: Unity and Unreal Engine.

- **Unity**: In Unity, I'm learning C#, a versatile programming language that allows me to create complex game mechanics and interactive experiences.
    
- **Unreal Engine**: With Unreal Engine, I'm diving into C++, a robust language that offers deep control over game systems and performance.
    

## My Passion

Visual effects (VFX) are my favorite aspect of games. The way VFX can transform a simple action into an awe-inspiring spectacle is truly magical. Additionally, I have a deep appreciation for the music and scenery in games. These elements not only enhance the visual appeal but also build the overall atmosphere, making the gaming experience memorable.

## Aspirations

My ultimate goal is to work for a renowned game development studio such as Naughty Dog or Sucker Punch. These companies are known for their ground-breaking games and innovative approaches to storytelling and gameplay. Being a part of such a team would be a dream come true, allowing me to contribute to the creation of extraordinary gaming experiences.

## Conclusion

This journey is just beginning, and I invite you to join me as I navigate the challenges and triumphs of learning game design. I'll be sharing my progress, insights, and the projects I work on along the way. Let's explore the intricacies of technology and game design together and watch as this zero-to-hero story unfolds.
